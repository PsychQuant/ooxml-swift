# Changelog

All notable changes to ooxml-swift will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `WordDocument.getCommentsFull() -> [Comment]` — returns the complete `Comment` struct for every comment in the document, exposing `parentId` (reply threading), `paraId`, `done`, and `initials`. Companion to the existing `getComments()` tuple API.

### Notes

- `getCommentsFull` is purely additive. The existing `getComments()` tuple API is unchanged.
- Motivation: the prior tuple-returning `getComments()` dropped `parentId`, forcing downstream consumers (e.g., manuscript review threading tools in che-word-mcp) to either lose reply structure or re-parse `comments.xml` manually. `getCommentsFull` provides the full struct without breaking existing callers.
- Spectra change: [`PsychQuant/macdoc:openspec/changes/manuscript-review-markdown-export`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/manuscript-review-markdown-export)
